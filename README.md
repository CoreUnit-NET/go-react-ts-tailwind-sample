# 🚀 React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS Dashboard

This project is a **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** dashboard frontend built to interface with the **[go-rest-sample](https://github.com/CoreUnit-NET/go-rest-sample)** REST API backend.

## 📦 Dependencies

- **[go-rest-sample](https://github.com/CoreUnit-NET/go-rest-sample)**: Backend REST API 🖥️
- **OpenAPI v3 Specs code generator**: Consider using **[OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)**, **[zijianhuang/openapiclientgen](https://github.com/zijianhuang/openapiclientgen)**, or **[openapitools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator)** to generate TypeScript client code from the backend OpenAPI spec. 🧑‍💻
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend 🎨

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project focuses on creating a **React**-based frontend that communicates with the **go-rest-sample** backend API.  

### 🛠️ The frontend will be built using:
- **React** for building the user interface ⚛️
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better maintainability 💻
- **TailwindCSS** for a modern, responsive design 🌟

The dashboard will provide a clean, intuitive way to manage backend resources like servers, containers, and services.  

### 👥 Users will be able to:
- **List** resources 📋
- **Create** new resources ➕
- **Update** existing resources ✏️
- **Delete** resources 🗑️

### 🔑 Key Features

- **Type-safe API Communication**: By using a TypeScript client generated from the OpenAPI v3 spec, the frontend will ensure easy integration and error-free communication with the backend. 🔒
- **OIDC Authentication**: Secure user access with **OIDC** via **auth.coreunit.net**, protecting your resources from unauthorized access. 🔑
- **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS will ensure the dashboard looks great on any device, whether it's a desktop or mobile. 📱💻
- **Fast Development**: With **Vite** as the build tool, expect rapid development and quick iterations. ⚡

## 🎉 Result

The goal is to create a seamless, user-friendly dashboard for managing backend resources through a well-structured frontend interface, all while ensuring security and ease of use. 🌈
